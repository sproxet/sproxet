Hi, I'm sproxet. My primary interests are in privacy preserving technologies, with which I've been
involved with for the better part of two decades, including cryptocurrencies since near their inception,
most notably as a core developer for the [Firo](https://firo.org) project, which is focused on bringing
privacy to the blockchain, and for which I wrote [Firo Client](https://github.com/firoorg/firo-client),
a modern graphical interface for our blockchain.

In my recent projects I've extensively used C++, Rust, circom, and JS/TypeScript, and have significant past
experience in Python, Solidity, Ruby, and C. I've used all the latest and greatest frameworks as they've
gained and lost popularity, and am always ready for something new.
